\item{gt_data}{data that is "local" to a particular group-time average
treatment effect}

and outcome regression models}

\description{
Takes a "local" data.frame and computes
an estimate of a group time average treatment effect
and a corresponding influence function using a difference in differences
approach.

The code relies on \code{gt_data} having certain variables defined.
In particular, there should be an \code{id} column (individual identifier),
\code{D} (treated group identifier), \code{period} (time period), \code{name}
(equal to "pre" for pre-treatment periods and equal to "post" for post
treatment periods), \code{Y} (outcome).

In our case, we call \code{pte::two_by_two_subset} which sets up the
data to have this format before the call to \code{did_attgt}.
