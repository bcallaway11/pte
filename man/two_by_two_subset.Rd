two_by_two_subset(
  data,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the full dataset}

\item{g}{the current group}

\item{tp}{the current time period}

\item{control_group}{whether to use "notyettreated" (default) or
"nevertreated"}

\item{anticipation}{the number of periods of anticipation (i.e., number
of periods before the treatment happens where the treatment can "already"
affect the outcome)}

\item{...}{extra arguments to get the subset correct}
}
\value{
list that contains correct subset of data, \code{n1}
number of observations
in this subset, and \code{disidx} a vector of the correct ids for this
subset.
}
\description{
A function for computing a 2x2 subset of original data.
This is the subset with post treatment periods separately for the
treated group and comparison group and pre-treatment periods in the period
immediately before the treated group became treated.
