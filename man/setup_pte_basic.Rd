confidence band (default is TRUE)}

The default is "att".  Different estimation strategies can implement
their own choices for \code{gt_type}}

this is a specific quantile at which to report results, e.g.,
\code{ret_quantile = 0.5} will return that the qte at the median.}

\description{
This is a lightweight (example) function for how to setup
the data to be used in the \code{pte} package.

\code{setup_pte_basic} takes in information about the structure of \code{data}
and returns a \code{pte_params} object.  The key piece of information
that is computed by this function is the list of groups and list of
time periods where ATT(g,t) should be computed.  In particular, this function
omits the never-treated group but includes all other groups and drops the first
time period.  This setup is basically geared towards the 2x2 case ---
i.e., where ATT could be identified with two periods, a treated and
untreated group, and the first period being pre-treatment for both groups.
This is the relevant case for DID, but is also relevant for other cases as well.
However, for example, if more pre-treatment periods were needed, then this
function should be replaced by something else.

For code that is written with the idea of being easy-to-use by other
researchers, this is a good place to do some error handling / checking
that the data is in the correct format, etc.
